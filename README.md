# MCE540-Eye_Tracking

Project which aims to track eye and head position, which is used as the base for an interactive vision therapy platform

### Prerequisites and dependencies

Please install the following libraries: `tensorflow` `dlib` `python-opencv` `numpy`  

Assuming python3 is being used and `pip` is the alias used for installations:
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib
pip install numpy
```

In some cases it might be necessary to install `wheel` using `pip`, as well as having set up a C compiler such as `gcc` to build `dlib`.
